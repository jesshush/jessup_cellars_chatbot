The tropical nature of our 2023 Sauvignon Blanc is decidedly different than the typical Sauvignon Blanc grown in the Valley and elsewhere in the World.

The stainless steel seals out the oxygen and seals in the flavors of the fruit and is a hearty 15.1% alcohol content with a PH of 3.3. While it's nose and flavors hint at tropical delights, we would not consider this wine to be too fruit forward, but rather fruit balanced with hints of pineapple and mango. Our Sauvignon Blanc is the perfect hot tub wine or for those warm summer evenings after a long day in the hot summer Sun. You will feel refreshed after enoying a glass or two of our Sauvignon Blanc, non-member price of $45!\n\nThe 2023 Sauvignon Blanc pairs wonderfully with a variety of dishes, enhancing the dining experience. For starters, it complements the flavors of Grilled Prawn Cocktail and Ceviche, accentuating the seafood's delicate taste and brightening the citrus elements in the dishes. The wine's fruity and floral notes beautifully complement the freshness of Tacos, making it an ideal match for this flavorful and versatile Mexican dish. Lastly, the wine's high acidity and fruit-forward character provide a delightful contrast to the creamy sweetness of a Peach & Burrata salad, creating a harmonious and memorable pairing."

        "responses": [
          "The Solera method is a traditional aging and blending process commonly used in the production of fortified wines, including dessert wines like Sherry and Madeira. Here's how it works:\n\nTiered Stacking: The process begins with a series of barrels or casks arranged in a tiered system called a \"solera stack.\" The bottom row contains the oldest wine, while subsequent rows contain progressively younger wines.\n\nFractional Blending: Each year, a portion of wine is drawn from the bottom row of barrels for bottling. This creates space in those barrels, which are then topped up with wine from the row above. The process continues up the stack, with each barrel being partially emptied and then replenished with younger wine.\n\nAging and Maturity: Because the barrels are only partially emptied each year, a portion of the older wine always remains in the barrels, contributing to the complexity and depth of flavor. Over time, the younger wines gradually blend with and inherit characteristics from the older wines.\n\nConsistency: The Solera method ensures consistency in the final product, as the blend of wines remains relatively constant over time. Even though some wine is removed for bottling each year, the overall character of the solera remains consistent due to the blending of older and younger wines.\n\nPerpetual Process: The Solera system is designed to be perpetual, with new wine continuously added at the top and matured wine drawn from the bottom for bottling. This allows producers to maintain a consistent product while also ensuring that some of the original wine remains in the solera stack, sometimes for many years or even decades.\n\nOverall, the Solera method is a meticulous and time-honored process that results in complex, well-balanced dessert wines with layers of flavor and aroma."

However, it's always a good idea to check Ad Hoc's website or call ahead to confirm the schedule, as restaurant operations and special events may vary.\nRO Restaurant and Lounge: Formerly the Regiis Ova Caviar & Champagne Lounge has reopened as a whole new dining spot in Yountville.

          "Rob’s foray into wine started directly after graduating college when he came to Napa to work in a tasting room for the summer – before getting a ‘real job’. He became fascinated with wine and the science of winemaking and began to learn everything he could about the process. While interviewing for that “real job”, the interviewer asked him what he had been doing with his time since graduation. After speaking passionately and at length about wine, the interviewer said, “You seem to love that so much. Why do you want this job?” Rob realized he didn't want it, actually. He thanked the man, and thus began a career in the wine industry. Rob has since earned his MS in Viticulture & Enology from the University of California Davis and worked for many prestigious wineries including Cakebread, Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars, and La Crema. Rob began crafting Jessup Cellars in the 2009 season and took the position of Director of Winemaking at Jessup Cellars in 2010. He now heads up our winemaking for the Good Life Wine Collective, which also includes Handwritten Wines."

Our Napa Valley Chardonnay is a member favorite while the non-member price of $55 is appreciated by enthusiasts of this quality wine crafted by Rob Lloyd.

The stainless steel seals out the oxygen and seals in the flavors of the fruit and is a hearty 15.1% alcohol content with a PH of 3.3. While it's nose and flavors hint at tropical delights, we would not consider this wine to be too fruit forward, but rather fruit balanced with hints of pineapple and mango. Our Sauvignon Blanc is the perfect hot tub wine or for those warm summer evenings after a long day in the hot summer Sun. You will feel refreshed after enjoying a glass or two of our Sauvignon Blanc, non-member price of $45!"

The alcohol content of this vintage is 14.8% with a PH of 3.45. This gives our 2021 Pinot Noir a much bolder color, very different from your typical light and bright Pinot you may be accustomed to.

This beautiful wine of co-fermented Grenache and Carignan varieties greets you with opulent aromas of sweet strawberry, ripe cranberry jam, red plum, cassis, and nutmeg. We age this wine by co-fermenting the varietals for 15 months in used (neutral) Chardonnay barrels and delivers a 14.9% alcohol content with a PH of 3.35. The non-member price is $60. The palate is wonderfully dry and lifted with fresh acidity and silky, rich tannins. Flavors of brambly, ripe fruit make this wine exceptionally palatable and food-friendly.

          "Jessup’s Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon is a staple of most Napa Valley winemakers with Jessup offering our 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon for 2024. As with most of our red wines, our winemakers exercise 'The Art of the Blend' by starting with 90% Napa Valley fruit from the Chiles Valley AVA in Northeastern Napa County, then blend in 5% Petite Sirah from the same AVA, 3% Merlot from our Truchard Vineyard in the Los Carneros region, then finish it with 2.1% Cabernet Franc, which is the parent grape of both Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, often used in blended wines. Cabernet Franc originated in the Bordeaux region of France and to honor that provenance, we age our 2019 Jessup Cellars Cabernet Sauvignon in 80% new French oak for 22 months. Alcohol content in this varietal is 14.9% with a PH of 3.65. You can purchase our 2019 Cab for $90. The palate of the wine matches the aromatics providing juicy fruit flavors, rich tannins and a long finish. This wine drinks well now however will age gracefully for the next 5-8 years.

        "responses": [
          "The Solera method is a traditional aging and blending process commonly used in the production of fortified wines, including dessert wines like Sherry and Madeira. The process works as follows: \n\n**Tiered Stacking**: The process begins with a series of barrels or casks arranged in a tiered system called a 'solera stack.' The bottom row contains the oldest wine, while subsequent rows contain progressively younger wines. \n\n**Fractional Blending**: Each year, a portion of wine is drawn from the bottom row of barrels for bottling. This creates space in those barrels, which are then topped up with wine from the row above. The process continues up the stack, with each barrel being partially emptied and then replenished with younger wine. \n\n**Aging and Maturity**: Because the barrels are only partially emptied each year, a portion of the older wine always remains in the barrels, contributing to the complexity and depth of flavor. Over time, the younger wines gradually blend with and inherit characteristics from the older wines. \n\n**Consistency**: The Solera method ensures consistency in the final product, as the blend of wines remains relatively constant over time. Even though some wine is removed for bottling each year, the overall character of the solera remains consistent due to the blending of older and younger wines. \n\n**Perpetual Process**: The Solera system is designed to be perpetual, with new wine continuously added at the top and matured wine drawn from the bottom for bottling. This allows producers to maintain a consistent product while also ensuring that some of the original wine remains in the solera stack, sometimes for many years or even decades. Overall, the Solera method is a meticulous and time-honored process that results in complex, well-balanced dessert wines with layers of flavor and aroma."
